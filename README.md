# Flux
**Flux** is a lightweight library to support Unidirectional Data Flow for building reactive apps. Originally **Flux** is an architecture that Facebook uses internally when working with React. It is not a framework or a library. It is simply a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow.
